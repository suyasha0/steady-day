# Day Planner

## Overview

When massive amounts of work and pressure piles up on us, it can be hard to stay motivated. When faced with a neverending list of things-to-do, sometimes we may spend the day doing none of it at all! This is where TITLE can help, by transforming your day into a steady and *rewarding* one using the power of short-term motivation.



Shoppy Shoperson is a web app that will allow users to keep track of multiple grocery lists. Users can register and login. Once they're logged in, they can create or view their grocery list. For every list that they have, they can add items to the list or cross off items.


## Data Model

(___TODO__: a description of your application's data and their relationships to each other_) 

The application will store Users, Lists and Items

* users can have multiple lists (via references)
* each list can have multiple items (by embedding)

(___TODO__: sample documents_)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "shannonshopper",
  hash: // a password hash,
  lists: // an array of references to List documents
}
```

An Example List with Embedded Items:

```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  name: "Breakfast foods",
  items: [
    { name: "pancakes", quantity: "9876", checked: false},
    { name: "ramen", quantity: "2", checked: true},
  ],
  createdAt: // timestamp
}
```


## [Link to Commented First Draft Schema](db.js) 

(___TODO__: create a first draft of your Schemas in db.js and link to it_)

## Wireframes

(___TODO__: wireframes for all of the pages on your site; they can be as simple as photos of drawings or you can use a tool like Balsamiq, Omnigraffle, etc._)

/list/create - page for creating a new shopping list

## Site map

(___TODO__: draw out a site map that shows how pages are related to each other_)

Here's a [complex example from wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Sitemap_google.jpg), but you can create one without the screenshots, drop shadows, etc. ... just names of pages and where they flow to.

1. as non-registered user, I can register a new account with the site
2. as a user, I can log in to the site
3. as a user, I can create a new grocery list
4. as a user, I can view all of the grocery lists I've created in a single list
5. as a user, I can add items to an existing grocery list
6. as a user, I can cross off items in an existing grocery list
